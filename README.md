## Description
This application is designed to search multiple cities and get the current weather and the forecast for the next 5 days. Its perfect for when you're traveling through multiple cities in a given week. Just input all of the cities along your route and it will save buttons for that city (up to 8 buttons) for you too look up later. The forecast will update itself any time you look at it, so you can be sure that you have up to date information.
